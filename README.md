Hi guys! I'm Eduardo Vedes (@evedes) and I've challenged myself in the first of January 2017 to reboot my career in 360 days. I've chosen to pursue a Full Stack Developer career. In order to achieve that I've started studying and practicing along in [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). I've already completed the Front End Certification and the Back End Certification and now I'm focused on the Data Viz Certification. I'm learning how to develop solutions with React Library and D3js.

This is my fifth REACT Project. I hope you like it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### OBJECTIVE:

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/PNJRyd/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### USER STORIES:

1. I have health, a level, and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.

2. All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.

3. I can move throughout a map, discovering items.

4. I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.

5. Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.

6. When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.

7. When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.

8. When I find and beat the boss, I win.

9. The game should be challenging, but theoretically winnable.
